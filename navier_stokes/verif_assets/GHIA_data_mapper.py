"""
Python program that opens an excel file in my computer with path: "D:\Ã‰cole\PI3\verfication_cavite.xlsx". It then takes the data from two columns 
starting at A3 and B3 respectively, but of variable length vertically, and copies relevant data into columns starting at M3 and N3 and ending at M19 and N19. 
The data relevant to copy is a map (basically a linear interpolation) of the original columns (of size Nx1 each) to the output columns at M3 and N3, 
each of size (17x1). Consider that the output columns are themselves selected data from 129 to 1, where the 17 cells represent the following indexes
starting at M3 and ending at M19: [129, 126, 125, 124, 123, 110, 96, 80, 65, 59, 37, 23, 14, 10, 9, 8, 1]. The program then saves the excel file with the new data.
